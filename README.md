# VAE-face
This repository contains an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch. The model is trained on images of human faces and can generate new images by sampling from the normal distribution and decoding them through the decoder. Additionally, the model has been applied to transform non-smiling faces into smiling ones.
